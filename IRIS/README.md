# IRIS Flower Classification using KNN

This is a machine learning model built to classify IRIS flowers using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## Dataset

The IRIS dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and consists of 150 samples of IRIS flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the model:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install scikit-learn
pip install sklearn
pip install numpy
```

Our Model predicting the output with the Accuracy of 96.66666666666667
